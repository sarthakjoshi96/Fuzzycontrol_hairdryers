 we aim to implement fuzzy
logic control to hair blow-dryers where the output air flow
and temperature will be controlled automatically instead of
manually. Conventional hair blow dryers have two to three
discrete setting options which leads to a permanent setting
to a fixed air speed and temperature for a long time. This
setting leads to unnecessary power consumption. Along with
being power efficient, our proposed controller will not only save
the machine parts from getting damaged but will also prevent
the human hairs from getting damaged because of excessive
heat flow from the dryer by also considering the dampness or
moisture of the hair
